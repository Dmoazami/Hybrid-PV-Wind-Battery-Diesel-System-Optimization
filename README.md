## 🔹 Overview

This repository contains **two professional Maple codes** for optimizing hybrid energy systems consisting of PV panels, wind turbines, battery storage, and diesel generators:

1. **Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)**  
2. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**  

Each code includes:  

- Optimal design calculation for hybrid energy systems  
- **Convergence plots** of the optimization algorithms  
- PDF file with **line-by-line explanation**  

This package is designed for **energy engineers, researchers, and graduate students**.
